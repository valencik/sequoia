Scala Up North

# Abstract

SQL remains the ubiquitous tool of data reporting, analysis, and exploration.
However, sharing context and common usage for datasets across teams is a manual and elective process, leading to poorly repeated patterns and bad habits.
This talk will review a new system, written in Scala, which enables SQL query analysis such as finding commonly joined tables, tracking column lineage, and discovering unused columns.
A primary focus of the effort is to increase data discovery among various data science teams.
